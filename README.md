Simple weather display for the CrowPanel EPS32 4,2" E-Paper Display. Reworked using the OpenWeather 3.0 API. Set for Imperial measurements but can be changed to Celcius in the code. Visibility is expressed in Miles so there may need to be changes to the conversation code from Meters to Miles in the code.
